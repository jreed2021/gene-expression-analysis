# gene-expression-analysis
Cleaning and analysis of the GSE344 gene expression dataset
## Project Overview
This project involves cleaning and analysis that GSE344 GEO dataset to ensure data integrity, remove inconsistencies, and visualize gene expression patterns. 

## Tools Used 
-Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
-Jypyter Notebook

## Key Tasks
-Cleaned missing and inconsistent values. 
-Transformed gene expression data into numeric format. 
-Created exploratory visualization of gene ID distributions. 

## Files
`GSE344_Gene_Expression_Cleanup.ipynb` : Jupyter Notebook Notebook with data cleaning and visualization.
`Cleaned_gene_expression_GSE344.csv`: Final cleaned dataset

## How to use 
-Open the Jupyter Notebook to explore data analysis steps. 
-Use the cleaned CVS file for further biological or statistical analysis
